# MasterProject

Scripts for automatic running of MadGraph. Computes cross sections and saves them in data files. 
There exists functions for computing exclusion and discovery significances and plotting these in graphs
which may include relic density constraints on cold DM and constant width/mass ratio lines for a VL fermion. 

For an explanation of how the code works and what it can be used for, see: <Add thesis when it is finished>
